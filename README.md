📘 About This Repository

This repository contains the Terraform (.tf) and YAML configuration files I’ve used to automate cloud resource provisioning and application deployment across various projects.
It serves as a collection of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and deployment automation examples that showcase how I structure and manage environments using tools like Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

These files demonstrate:
	•	Reusable Terraform modules for provisioning infrastructure.
	•	YAML configuration files for container orchestration, CI/CD workflows, and deployment pipelines.
	•	Best practices for managing environments through version-controlled automation.
	•	Examples of past project setups, highlighting real-world implementations of DevOps and cloud automation principles.
